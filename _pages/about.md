I'm a research scientist at Samsung Research America. At Samsung, I worked on topics including: model compression and continual learning, with applications on natural lanaguage understand (NLU) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). 
Before joining Samsung, my research interests were probabilistic graphical models (e.g., LDA) and deep generative models (e.g., VAE), with applications on social media data and low-resource language data.
I received my Ph.D. from Virgina Tech in 2017.
