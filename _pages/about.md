I'm a research scientist at Samsung Research America. At Samsung, I worked on various machine learning topics including: model compression, continuous learning, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). 
Before joining Samsung, my research interests were probabilistic graphical models (e.g., LDA) and deep generative models (e.g., VAE), with applications on social media data and low-resource language data.
I received my Ph.D. from Virgina Tech in 2017 on machine learning and data mining. 



My publications grouped by topic:

- Model Compression [[EMNLP2022](/publications/#hua2022numerical),
[ICLR2022a](/publications/#hsu2022language), 
[ICLR2022a](/publications/#lou2022dictformer), 
[CVPR2022](/publications/#lou2022lite)]
- Network Architecture Search [[IJCAI2021](/publications/#zhao2021automatic)]
- Continual Learning  [[NAACL2021](/publications/#hua2022hyperparameter)]
- Topical Modeling [[TKDD2020](/publications/#hua2020probabilistic), [IJCAI2018](/publications/#hua2018social), [AAAI2016](/publications/#hua2016topical)]
- event detection [ [CIKM2016](/publications/#hua2016automatical), [GeoInformatica2016](/publications/#hua2016automatic), [KDD2014](/publications/#ramakrishnan2014beating), [KDD2014](/publications/#ramakrishnan2014beating)[KDD2013](/publications/#hua2013sted)]
