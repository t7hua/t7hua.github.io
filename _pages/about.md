I'm a research scientist at Samsung Research America. 

Previously, as alternative military service for the South Korean army, I worked as a research scientist at [Kakao](https://www.kakaocorp.com/) and [AITRICS](https://www.aitrics.com/), working with [Juho Lee](https://juho-lee.github.io/).
Before that, I completed my master's (CS, advised by [Seungjin Choi](http://mlg.postech.ac.kr/~seungjin)) and undergraduate (math) degrees at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/).

My research interest is in developing models capable of **learning and decision-making in changing environments**.
To do so, I believe we should go beyond the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) paradigm and account for the variability of real-world conditions in our learning procedures.
Two alternative problem formulations of interest to me are _meta-learning_ and _distribution-shift robustness_, which encode the non-static nature of data generating processes through notions of _tasks_ and _domains_.
